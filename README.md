# AutoChess

AutoChess is a chess board to play chess alone and feel as real and traditional as possible.

# Note
Please be aware that AutoChess is (and probably always will be) a work in progress!

## How AutoChess come to be

AutoChess come to be from the frustration that come from playing chess (and honestly, losing :sweat_smile:) on my smartphone instead of a proper full size board. 

In addition to a personal project, AutoChess turned into ours electrical engineering degree final project for HIT college.

## AutoChess objectives

AutoChess have several objectives:

- Give the user the option to play chess alone on an actual chess board.
- Give the user the option to play alone (vs AI) or with a remote friend (that have or don't have a AutoChess board).
- Give the user the experience of playing on an actual traditional chess board.
- Give the user the ability to play remotely with friend even if they don't own a AutoChess board.
